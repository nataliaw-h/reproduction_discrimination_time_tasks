# Time Perception Experiment: Reproduction Discrimination Tasks

This experiment aims to gauge the accuracy of a participant's time perception, serving as a useful tool in scientific research to explore correlations between time perception and various other variables. It comprises two independent tasks:

**1. Light Bulb Task:** This task involves 30 trials where a light bulb turns on and off. The participant's task is to reproduce the duration for which the light bulb remained illuminated.

**2. Picture Display Task:** This task includes 30 trials where two pictures are displayed one after another. The participant's task is to identify which picture was displayed for a longer duration.

Each task incorporates test trials that can be repeated numerous times. Please note that neither task necessitates the use of a mouse.

The experiment comprises four interrelated files: index.php, index2.php, index3.php, and index4.php. The files index2.php and index4.php are designated to save data in two separate tables with unique ID codes. It is essential to input the ID within the URL.

Developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.
